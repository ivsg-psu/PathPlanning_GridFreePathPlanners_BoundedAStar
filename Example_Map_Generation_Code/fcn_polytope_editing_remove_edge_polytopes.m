% [TRIM_POLYTOPES]=FCN_POLYTOPE_EDITING_REMOVE_EDGE_POLYTOPES(POLYTOPES,XLOW,XHIGH,YLOW,YHIGH)
% returns:
% TRIM_POLYTOPES: a 1-by-n seven field structure of polytopes within the
% boundaries, where n <= number of polytopes with fields:
%   vertices: a m+1-by-2 matrix of xy points with row1 = rowm+1, where m is
%     the number of the individual polytope vertices
%   xv: a 1-by-m vector of vertice x-coordinates
%   yv: a 1-by-m vector of vertice y-coordinates
%   distances: a 1-by-m vector of perimeter distances from one point to the
%     next point, distances(i) = distance from vertices(i) to vertices(i+1)
%   mean: centroid xy coordinate of the polytope
%   area: area of the polytope
%
% with inputs:
% POLYTOPES: the original polytopes with the same fields as trim_polytopes
% XLOW: lower x boundary
% XHIGH: upper x boundary
% YLOW: lower y boundary
% YHIGH: upper y boundary
%
% Examples:
%   polytopes = fcn_polytope_generation_halton_voronoi_tiling(1,100);
%   fig = fcn_plot_polytopes(polytopes,[],'b',2,[0 1 0 1]);
