% fcn_Visibility_removeObstacle
%   this function recalculates the visibility graph after deleting a polytope without recalculating
%   the entire visibility graph.  This is accomplished using an AABB check as a coarse check.
%   This function also recalculates the all_pts, start, finish, and polytopes data structures
%   as these are also affected by the removal of an obstacle.

% FORMAT:
% [visibility_matrix_new, all_pts_new, start_new, finish_new, polytopes_after] = ...
%     fcn_Visibility_removeObstacle(...
%     visibility_matrix, all_pts, start, finish, polytopes_before, idx_of_polytope_for_removal, (fig_num))
%
% INPUTS:
%
%     visibility_matrix: nxn matrix, where n is the number of points in all_pts
%       a 1 in column i and row j indicates that all_pts(i,:) is visible from
%       all_pts(j,:).  This matrix is therefore symmetric
%     
%     all_pts: p-by-5 matrix of all the possible start points
%       the information in the 5 columns is as follows:
%         x-coordinate
%         y-coordinate
%         point id number
%         obstacle id number
%         beginning/ending indication (1 if the point is a beginning or ending
%         point and 0 otherwise)
%         Ex: [x y point_id obs_id beg_end]
%     
%     start: 1-by-5 vector with the same info as route for the starting point
%     
%     finish: same as start for the finish point
%
%     polytopes_before: the polytope struct array prior to modification INCLUDING the polytope for removal
%     
%     idx_of_polytope_for_removal: the index of the polytope to be removed in the polytopes_before struct array
%
%     (optional inputs)
%
%     fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%         input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%         up code to maximize speed. As well, if given, this forces the
%         variable types to be displayed as output and as well makes the input
%         check process verbose
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     visibility_matrix_new: same as the visiblity_matrix input but modified so that the removed
%         removed polytope no longer affects the visibility.  Note this may have fewer points than
%         the input matrix as points on the removed polytope are deleted.
%
%     all_pts_new: same as the all_pts input but with points on the removed polytope deleted.
%         May be reindexed
%
%     start_new: same as start input but reindexed to account for removed points
%     
%     finish_new: same as finish input but reindexed to account for removed points
%     
%     polytopes_after:  the polytope struct array after modification no longer including
%         the polytope for removal
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%     fcn_MapGen_isCrossingAABB from the MapGen repo
%     fcn_Visibility_clearAndBlockedPoints

% REVISION HISTORY:
% 2024_03
% -- first written by Steve Harnett
% Questions? sjh6473@psu.edu
% 2025_07_17 - K. Hayes, kxh1031@psu.edu
% -- copied to new function from fcn_visibility_graph_remove_obstacle
%    to follow library convention
% 2025_07_31 - K. Hayes
% -- updated function formatting and header
% -- added input and debug checks

% TO DO:
% (none)

    end
end

if flag_do_debug
    st = dbstack; %#ok<*UNRCH>
    fprintf(1,'STARTING function: %s, in file: %s\n',st(1).name,st(1).file);
