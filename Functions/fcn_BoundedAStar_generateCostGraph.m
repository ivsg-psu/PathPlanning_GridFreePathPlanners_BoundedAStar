function [cgraph, hvec] = fcn_BoundedAStar_generateCostGraph(all_pts, start, finish, mode, varargin)
% fcn_BoundedAStar_generateCostGraph
%
% A function for generating a cost matrix and heuristic cost vector.  The cost matrix describes the
% actual cost to go from one point to another in a map.  The heuristic vector describes the estimated
% cost of going from each point to the goal.  If there are multiple goals, this is the minimum of
% going to any goal because the heuristic should be an underestimate of the actual cost (see:
% http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html).  Note using this function
% is completely optional.  It is commonly used prior to calling a planner such as Astar
% to conveniently generate a cost map but it may be circumvented if the user wishes to generate
% their own cost function and cost function matrix
%
%
% FORMAT:
% [cgraph, hvec] = fcn_BoundedAStar_generateCostGraph(all_pts, start, finish, mode, (fig_num))
%
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   start: the start point vector as (x,y,id) or (x,y,t,id)
%
%   finish: the finish point matrix of all valid finishes where each row is a single finish point
%     vector as (x,y,id) or (x,y,t,id)
%
%   all_pts: the point matrix of all point that can be in the route, except the start and finish where
%       each row is a single point vector (x,y,t,id)
%
%   mode: a string for how the cost should be expressed. The mode argument must be a string with
%     one of the following values:
%       - "xyz or xyt" - full 3D cost of the Euclidean distance between two points in x,y,z or x,y,t
%       - "time or z only" - cost between two points is only based on their t or z distance
%       - "xy spatial only" - cost between two points is based on their x-y Euclidean distance
%
%   (optional inputs)
% 
%   fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%   input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%   up code to maximize speed. As well, if given, this forces the
%   variable types to be displayed as output and as well makes the input
%   check process verbose
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%    cgraph: the cost graph matrix. A cost matrix is an nxn matrix where n is
%      the number of points (nodes) in the map including the start and goal.
%      The value of element i-j is the cost of routing from i to j.
%
%    hvec: the heuristic cost vector. A 1xn vector where n is
%      the number of points (nodes) in the map including the start and goal.
%      The value of element k is the estimated cost of routing from point k to
%      the finish based on a heuristic cost estimation method.
