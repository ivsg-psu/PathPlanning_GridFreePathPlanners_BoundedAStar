% fcn_BoundedAStar_AStarBounded
%
% performs Astar path planning algorithm from
% start to finish around polytopes while constantly reducing boundaries
%
% FORMAT:
%
% [cost,route] = fcn_BoundedAStar_AstarBounded(start,finish,polytopes,all_pts,bound_pts,planner_mode,(ellipse_polytopes),(fig_num))
%
% INPUTS:
%
%     start: the start point vector (x, y, id, obs_id, beg_end)
%
%     finish: the finish point matrix of all valid finishes where each row
%     is a single finish point vector (x, y, id, obs_id, beg_end)
%
%     polytopes:
%
%     all_pts: the p-by-5 matrix of all the points except start and finish
%
%     bound_pts: subset of valid points that are usable
%
%     planner_mode: string containing option for planner behavior that indicates the planner mode
%       "legacy" only goes around obstacles
%       "through at vertices" allows the planner to go through or around each obstacle
%           but only entering or exiting at vertices
%       "through or around" allows the planner to go through all obstacles or around all
%       "straight through" the planner only goes straight from the start to the goal, calculating the cost
%
%     (optional inputs)
%
%     ellipse_polytopes: polytopes used to determine the ellipse used for
%     bounding the points
%
%     fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%     input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%     up code to maximize speed. As well, if given, this forces the
%     variable types to be displayed as output and as well makes the input
%     check process verbose
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%     cost: the total cost of the selected route
%
%    route: the mx5 matrix as produced by consisting of waypoints.  Each row is a
%    waypoint, and each column is [x-coordinate, y-coordinate, point id, obstacle id,
%       beginning or end of an obstacle set (1 or 0)]
