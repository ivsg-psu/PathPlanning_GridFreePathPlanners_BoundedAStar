%
% INPUTS:
%
%   polytopes: a 1-by-n seven field structure of shrunken polytopes,
%       where n <= number of polytopes with fields:
%           vertices: a m+1-by-2 matrix of xy points with row1 = rowm+1, where m is
%           the number of the individual polytope vertices
%           xv: a 1-by-m vector of vertice x-coordinates
%           yv: a 1-by-m vector of vertice y-coordinates
%           distances: a 1-by-m vector of perimeter distances from one point to the
%           next point, distances(i) = distance from vertices(i) to vertices(i+1)
%           mean: centroid xy coordinate of the polytope
%           area: area of the polytope
%   
%   cur_pt: the 1x5 array representing the current point, expected to be a vertex of a polytope
% 
%   all_pts: p-by-5 matrix of all the points except start and finish
%
%   (optional inputs)
%
%   fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%       input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%       up code to maximize speed. As well, if given, this forces the
%       variable types to be displayed as output and as well makes the input
%       check process verbose
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%   cur_obs_id: obstacle ID of the polytope that cur_pt is a vertex of
%
%   self_blocked_cost: polytope traversal scaling of the polytope the cur_pt is a vertex of
% 
%   pts_blocked_by_self: the other vertices on the polytope that cur_pt is a vertex of
%       that cannot be seen from cur_pt (i.e. neither neighboring vertex which would be visible
%       by looking down the side of a convex polytope)

% Revision History:
% 2025_07_17 - K. Hayes, kxh1031@psu.edu
% -- copied to new function from fcn_visibility_self_blocked_pts to
%    follow library convention
% 2025_07_31 - K. Hayes
% -- reformatted function and updated header
% -- added input and debug capabilities

% TO DO
% -- implement contingency for concave polytopes
