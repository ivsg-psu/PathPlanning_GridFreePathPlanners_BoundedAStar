function hvec = fcn_algorithm_generate_heuristic_vector(all_pts, start, finish, dimensions, mode, visibility_weight, reachability_weight)
% generate vector of heuristic costs from each point to the finish
% dimension - '2d' or '3d' to indicate if each point has 2 or three dimensions
% mode indicates how the cost should be expressed and can be "2d spatial", "time or z", "3d spatial"
% visibility_weight is the relative weighting of the visibility term
% reachability_weight is the relative weighting of the reachability term
end % end function
