function [cost, route] = fcn_BoundedAStar_Astar3d(vgraph, cgraph, hvec, all_pts, start, finish, varargin)
% fcn_BoundedAStar_Astar3d
%
% A minimal version of the A* algorithm for graph searching.  Designed to contain minimal subproceses e.g. visibility graph
% This assumes points are 3D e.g. having an x, y, and z or t dimensions
%
% FORMAT:
% [cost, route] = fcn_BoundedAStar_Astar3d(vgraph, cgraph, hvec, all_pts, start, finish, (fig_num))
%
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   vgraph: the visibility graph as an nxn matrix where n is the number of points (nodes) in the map.
%       A 1 is in position i,j if point j is visible from point i.  0 otherwise.
%
%    cgraph: the cost graph matrix. A cost matrix is an nxn matrix where n is
%      the number of points (nodes) in the map including the start and goal.
%      The value of element i-j is the cost of routing from i to j.
%
%    hvec: the heuristic cost vector. A 1xn vector where n is
%      the number of points (nodes) in the map including the start and goal.
%      The value of element k is the estimated cost of routing from point k to
%      the finish based on a heuristic cost estimation method.
%
%   start: the start point vector (x,y,t,id)
%
%   finish: the finish point matrix of all valid finishes where each row is a single finish point vector (x,y,t,id)
%
%   all_pts: the (n-2)x4 point matrix of all point that can be in the route, except the start and finish where
%       each row is a single point vector (x,y,t,id)
%
%   (optional inputs)
%
%   fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%     input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%     up code to maximize speed. As well, if given, this forces the
%     variable types to be displayed as output and as well makes the input
%     check process verbose
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%     cost: the total cost of the selected route
%
%    route: the matrix as produced by fcn_BoundedAStar_Astar3d consisting of waypoints.  Each row is a
%    waypoint, and each column is x, y, t, and point ID
%
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
% fcn_DebugTools_checkInputsToFunctions
%
%    also, several functions exist to create visibility matrices and fcn_BoundedAStar_generateCostGraph can create cost matrices (cgraph) and heuristic cost vectors (hvec)
%

% See the script: script_test_fcn_BoundedAStar_AStar3d
