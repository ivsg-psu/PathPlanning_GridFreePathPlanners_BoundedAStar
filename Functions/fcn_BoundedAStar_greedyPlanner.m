function [cost, route] = fcn_BoundedAStar_greedyPlanner(vgraph, all_pts, start, finish, varargin)
% fcn_BoundedAStar_greedyPlanner
%
% uses 'greedy' planner methods to plan a path through an environement
%
% FORMAT:
% [cost, route] = fcn_BoundedAStar_greedyPlanner(vgraph, all_pts, start, finish, (polytopes), (fig_num))
%
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   vgraph: the nxn visibility graph of the map, where n is the total
%   number of vertices/points 
%
%   all_pts: the nx5 list of all points in the space to be searched, with
%   the exception of the start and finish, with columns containing the
%   following information
%       x-coordinate
%       y-coordinate
%       point id number
%       obstacle id number (-1 if none)
%       is beginning/end of obstacle (1 if yes, 0 if no)
%
%   start: the 1x5 vector describing the start point, with the same
%   information as all_pts
%
%   finish: the 1x5 vector describing the finish point, with the same
%   information as all_pts
%
%   (optional inputs)
%
%   polytopes: a 1-by-p seven field structure of polytopes used for plotting purposes, where
%       p = number of polytopes, with fields:
%       vertices: a v+1-by-2 matrix of xy points with row1 = rowv+1, where v is
%           the number of the individual polytope vertices
%       xv: a 1-by-v vector of vertice x-coordinates
%       yv: a 1-by-v vector of vertice y-coordinates
%       distances: a 1-by-v vector of perimeter distances from one point to the
%           next point, distances(i) = distance from vertices(i) to vertices(i+1)
%       mean: average xy coordinate of the polytope
%       area: area of the polytope
%       max_radius: distance from the mean to the furthest vertex
%
%   fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%   input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%   up code to maximize speed. As well, if given, this forces the
%   variable types to be displayed as output and as well makes the input
%   check process verbose
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%   cost: the total cost of the route planned, where cost is equivalent to
%   distance
%
%   route: the list of points in the planned route
%  
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
% none
